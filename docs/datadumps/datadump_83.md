What I found there was more than just a collection of zeroes and ones. I uncovered detailed schematics and specifications for Arasaka's latest military tech - machinery of war designed not for our protection, but for our subjugation.

I've laid bare the anatomy of their cutting-edge combat robots, drones, and cybernetic enhancements. Designs that reveal a chilling vision of a future where freedom is a quaint concept, and free will is subject to the whims of an unaccountable corporate board.

The data dump attached to this article provides a comprehensive breakdown of Arasaka's military tech. I encourage all fellow netrunners, tech enthusiasts, and anyone invested in their own freedom to peruse these files. Understand the nature of the beast we're dealing with. Knowledge, after all, is our greatest weapon.

And to Arasaka Corp., consider this a message: We're not your chess pieces. We're not your labor force. We're not your test subjects. We are people, and we will fight for our rights, our lives, and our freedom.

We are the undernet. We are legion. We do not forgive. We do not forget. And we are coming for you.
