**WTF is this? - The 'real' about page.**

**NeoWire** is an in-universe 'blog' chronicling the events of my [Cyberpunk Red](https://rtalsoriangames.com/cyberpunk/) campaign: "A Conspiracy for the Past".

All of the actual text on this site is fictional, and probably written by an AI.

The site is using [mkdocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) under the hood.
The theme used is [mkdocs-terminal](https://github.com/ntno/mkdocs-terminal) with some tweaks.
You can find the source code for the site on [github](https://github.com/zanderhavgaard/neowire).
**NeoWire** is created by [@zanderhavgaard](https://github.com/zanderhavgaard)
