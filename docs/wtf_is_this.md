**WTF is this? - The 'real' about page.**

**NeoWire** is an in-universe 'blog' chronicling the events of my [Cyberpunk Red](https://rtalsoriangames.com/cyberpunk/) campaign: "A Conspiracy for the Past".

All of the actual text on this site is fictional, and probably written by an AI.
All images on this blog were generated by an AI, unless stated otherwise.

The site is using [mkdocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) under the hood.
The site uses a custom mkdocs theme, you can check it out in the github repository.
You can find the source code for the site on [github](https://github.com/zanderhavgaard/neowire).
**NeoWire** is created by [@zanderhavgaard](https://github.com/zanderhavgaard)
